    <h3>Q. You are provided with two numbers
        A
        and
        B
        . Your task is to add these two numbers. </h3>

    Ans:- const AddTwoNumbers = (a,b) => { 
    return (a+b); 
    };
    
  <h3>  Q. You are given two number first as A and second as B and check if both conditions (A<10 and A>B ) are satisfied or
    not with the help of operators.</h3>

        Ans:- <pre>const AddTwoNumbers = (a,b) => {
            return (a<10 ) && (a>b) ? true:false
                };</pre>

                and
                B
                . You need to do the following checks:
    
                if both are divisible by 10 console true.
                if both are not divisible by 10 console false.
                if one of them only is divisible by 10 console true.
                Use operator to do this. </h3>

            <h3>Q>You are provided a four digit number N only. Your task is to print out the first digit of that number.</h3>
            Ans:- <pre>const First_Digit = (n) => {
                while (n >= 10)
